This app runs on yarn .v1, build in Typescript and compiled with Babel. I decided not to use Redux, nor context. 

The only 3rd party libraries used here besides React are react-select - due to the amount of time required to prepare a smooth select from scratch, and emotion in order to have a nice way to write styles.

To start: `yarn run start:client` 

To check TS: `yarn run start-tsc:client`
