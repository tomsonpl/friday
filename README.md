This app runs on yarn .v1, build in Typescript and compiled with Babel. I decided not to use Redux, nor context. 

The only 3rd party library used here besides React is react-select, due to the amount of time required to prepare a smooth select from scratch.

To start: `yarn run start:client` 

To check TS: `yarn run start-tsc:client`
